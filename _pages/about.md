I am currently a research fellow in Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I obtained my Bachelor degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2020. Then I started my PhD journey in NTU under Prof T. C. H. Liew's supervision and I succeseefully passed the defense in November 2024. My research interest is about novel topological phases in exciton-polariton.
